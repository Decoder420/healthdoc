"""POST /billing/invoices/{invoice_id}/issue — the missing draft -> issued step.

Why this existed as a gap
-------------------------
`build_invoice` creates the invoice with status='draft'. `record_payment`
refuses anything outside ("issued", "partially_paid"). The only two assignments
to `invoice.status` in the whole application live inside record_payment and
create_refund, both of which require the invoice to be payable already.

Nothing bridged the two, so no invoice the application built could ever be paid.

It stayed invisible because tests/integration/test_billing_journey.py defines
`_issue_invoice()`, which opens its own engine and runs
`UPDATE invoices SET status='issued'` in raw SQL. The integration test proved
the journey worked by performing, itself, the one step the product was missing.

Runs against real PostgreSQL (tests/billing/conftest.py), which matters here:
trg_invoices_freeze is a database trigger and does not exist in the ORM-built
SQLite schema the shared fixture uses. test_issuing_engages_the_freeze_trigger
is only meaningful because of that.
