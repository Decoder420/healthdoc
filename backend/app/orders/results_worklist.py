"""GET /orders/results-worklist — the doctor's outstanding results.

The screen that asks "what have I ordered, what has come back, and what still
needs my sign-off". It had no backend: the frontend fixture's own docstring
said it was "backed by GET /pathology/order-items and GET /radiology/order-items,
joined with each item's current result" — a join across two modules that no
endpoint performed and that the browser cannot do without fetching every order
item in the facility.

Why one endpoint rather than two calls plus a client-side merge:

  * The lab and radiology halves must be ranked against each other. A STAT lab
    and a routine scan sort into one list; two independently-paged calls cannot
    produce that ordering without over-fetching both.
  * The review status comes from doctor_reviews, which is keyed by
    lab_order_item_id OR radiology_order_item_id. Resolving it per row in the
    browser is N+1 over a clinician's whole worklist.

Scoping follows queue.service.get_doctor_worklist, the established precedent:
a doctor sees their own, an admin sees the facility. Both are facility-scoped
first — `orders.facility_id` is the boundary, and it is applied to both halves
of the union rather than to the result, so neither half can leak on its own.
